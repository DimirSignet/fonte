<b>What steps will reproduce the problem?</b>

1. create an enum with any syntax
my example:
/** 
@type {Object}
*/
var NS = {};

/**
@enum {number}
*/
NS.keys = { 
	a: 1, 
	b: 2, 
	c: 3
};

/**
@enum
*/
window['gKEYS'] = NS.keys;


2. complie with --compilation_level ADVANCED_OPTIMIZATIONS --summary_detail_level 3 --warning_level VERBOSE

3. look at the % typed

<b>What is the expected output? What do you see instead?</b>
it shouldn't count the enum as un-typed; it does...

<b>What version of the product are you using? On what operating system?</b>

<b>Please provide any additional information below.</b>

i also tried to tersely coerce the type, eg:
/** @type {number} */ a:  (/** @type {number} */(1)),

which has no effect.
