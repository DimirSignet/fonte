In the attached reduction if the &quot;echo&quot; functions aren't used then the entire body of the function is compiled away, they are there to demonstrate that the first assignment in the condition is removed.


Original:

function reduction()
{
    var a, b;
    if (echo(b = true) || echo(b = false))
        a = b;
    else
        a = null;
    return a;
}


Compiled:

function reduction() {
    var a;
    return echo(true) || echo(a = false) ? a: null
}
