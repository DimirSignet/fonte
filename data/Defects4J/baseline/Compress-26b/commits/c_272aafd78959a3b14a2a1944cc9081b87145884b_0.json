After these 8 bytes\n+ * the archive entries are listed. The format of an entry header is as it follows:\n+ * \n+ * <code>\n+ * START BYTE   END BYTE    NAME                    FORMAT      LENGHT\n+ * 0            15          File name               ASCII       16\n+ * 16           27          Modification timestamp  Decimal     12\n+ * 28           33          Owner ID                Decimal     6\n+ * 34           39          Group ID                Decimal     6\n+ * 40           47          File mode               Octal       8\n+ * 48           57          File size (bytes)       Decimal     10\n+ * 58           59          File magic              \\140\\012    2\n+ * </code>\n+ * \n+ * This specifies that an ar archive entry header contains 60 bytes.\n+ * \n+ * Due to the limitation of the file name length to 16 bytes GNU and BSD has\n+ * their own variants of this format.
