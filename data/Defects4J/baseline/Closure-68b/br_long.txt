<b>What steps will reproduce the problem?</b>
1.  test.js:

    /**
     * @type function
     */
    var callback;

2. java -jar compiler.jar --js test.js 

<b>What is the expected output? What do you see instead?</b>

Warning reported is:

test.js:3: WARNING - Parse error. Unexpected end of file
 */
  ^

Expected to see the actual warning (e.g., &quot;expected '('&quot;, for the *previous* line)

<b>What version of the product are you using? On what operating system?</b>

compiler-20110502

<b>Please provide any additional information below.</b>

Simply adding &quot;()&quot; to it (&quot;@type function()&quot;) removes the warning, but it would be much more effective if it could communicate that properly.
