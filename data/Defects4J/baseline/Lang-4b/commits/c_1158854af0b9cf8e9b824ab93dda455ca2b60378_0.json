The point of the ExceptionWithoutCause is to test for false-positive nested exception method signature matches.  Documented this in the header JavaDoc for both the ExceptionWithCause and ExceptionWithoutCause classes, and changed the nested exception method name of the latter from getCause() to getTargetException() to avoid conflicts with getCause() method of JDK 1.4's Exception class (which returns Throwable).
