<b>What steps will reproduce the problem?</b>
1.  Create a JS file called &quot;get_num.js&quot; with the contents &quot;var getNum = function() { return 5; };&quot;
2.  Create a JS file called &quot;alert.js&quot; with the contents &quot;alert(getNum());&quot;
3.  Compile the two files with the following command:

java -jar compiler.jar --language_in=ECMASCRIPT5_STRICT --compilation_level=ADVANCED_OPTIMIZATIONS --warning_level=VERBOSE --js get_num.js --js alert.js

<b>What is the expected output? What do you see instead?</b>

I would expect the output to be:

'use strict';alert(5);

or, if the compiler wants to be really clever, just &quot;alert(5)&quot; since this is already ES5 Strict compliant.
