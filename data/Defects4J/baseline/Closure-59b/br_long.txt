<b>What steps will reproduce the problem?</b>
1. Run command line utility
2. Supply flags --warning_level VERBOSE --jscomp_off globalThis --jscomp_off nonStandardJsDocs

<b>What is the expected output? What do you see instead?</b>
I expect that globalThis and nonStandardJsDocs warnings will be ignored. Only nonStandardJsDocs warnings are ignored.

<b>What version of the product are you using? On what operating system?</b>
Version 1180
Sun OS 5.10

<b>Please provide any additional information below.</b>
--jscomp_error also doesn't work with globalThis (works with nonStandardJSDocs).
