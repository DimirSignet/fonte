<b>What steps will reproduce the problem?</b>
1. Use Google Closure Compiler to compile this code:

    var a =(Math.random()&gt;0.5? '1' : 2 ) + 3 + 4;

You can either simple or advanced. It doesn't matter


<b>What is the expected output? What do you see instead?</b>

I'm seeing this as a result:
    var a = (0.5 &lt; Math.random() ? 1 : 2) + 7;

This is obviously wrong as the '1' string literal got converted to a number, and 3+4 got combined into 7 while that's not ok as '1' + 3 + 4 = '134', not '17'.

Seems like this issue happens only when you are mixing types together. If both 1 and 2 are string literals or if they are both numbers it won't happen. I was also a little surprised to see this happening in simple mode as it actually breaks the behavior.
