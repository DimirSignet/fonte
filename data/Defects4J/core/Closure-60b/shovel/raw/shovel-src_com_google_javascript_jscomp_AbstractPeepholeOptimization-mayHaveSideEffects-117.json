      "commitMessage": "\nChanges to completely remove goog.userAgent as required by\njavatests/com/google/javascript/closure/CompileUserAgentTest.  This\nrequires three changes:\n\n1) being able to remove expressions without side-effects in the global\nscope with the PeepholeRemoveDeadCode pass. This is simply a change to\nhandle both BLOCK and SCRIPT.\n\n2) a change to be able to fold constant result if conditions that have\nside-effects (a \u003d 1).  This was a change to include a smarter version\nof NodeUtil.getBooleanValue. A general expression evaluator would be\npreferred.\n\n3) and finally a bit of a hack to handle assignments followed by if\nstatements.  I would prefer a general solution, but this works well\nenough for this purpose.  A good general solution would need a general\nin-place expression evaluator and control-flow value propagation, both\nof which I\u0027ve special cased. It handles this:\n\na \u003d /MSIE/\nif (a) {\na.exec(value);\n}\n\n(we want the regexp object to get inlined into the exec call so it is known to\nbe side-effect free).\n\nR\u003dgboyer,acleung\nDELTA\u003d388  (333 added, 28 deleted, 27 changed)\n\n\nRevision created by MOE tool push_codebase.\nMOE_MIGRATION\u003d90004\n\n\ngit-svn-id: https://closure-compiler.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@326 b0f006be-c8cd-11de-a2e8-8d36a3108c74\n",
