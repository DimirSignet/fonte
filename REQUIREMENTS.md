# Requirements
## Hardware
- Developed under Mac with Intel chip.
- Compatible with AMD64 processors.

## Operating System
The artifact was mainly tested on OSX. It is also compatible with other Unix-based operating systems, including Linux, and has been tested with two shell script languages, bash and zsh. Although we have also tested the artifact using PowerShell on Windows, the instructions provided in the artifact are written for use on a Unix-based system, and the use of other operating systems, such as Windows, is not explicitly supported.

## Software
- Python 3.9
  - Python packages: `numpy==1.21.0, pandas==1.4.3, scipy==1.9.0, tqdm, matplotlib==3.4.0, seaborn==0.11.1, rank-bm25==0.2.2, tabulate==0.8.9, jupyter, setuptools, lib/SBFL, lib/spiral`
- Docker client (only needed for replication or extension).
