<p>The contents of this directory are a subset of materials created by Simon Butler at the Open University, and made available as part of the zip archive of INTT put online in 2011 at the following website:</p>
<p><a href="http://oro.open.ac.uk/28352/" rel="nofollow">http://oro.open.ac.uk/28352/</a></p>
<p>The zip file <code>tests.zip</code> in the present directory is a copy of the <code>tests</code> subdirectory from the INNT 0.2.0 download.  (It is not the complete INTT software.) Here is a direct link to the original INTT file from which <code>tests.zip</code> was derived:</p>
<p>[<a href="http://oro.open.ac.uk/28352/1/intt-0.2.0%5B1%5D.zip" rel="nofollow">http://oro.open.ac.uk/28352/1/intt-0.2.0%5B1%5D.zip</a>]</p>
<p>The PDF file in this directory is a snapshot of the page as it appeared on 2018-01-07.</p>
<p>The purpose of this copy is to retain a record of what was used to develop our code the CASICS Extractor module, in case the original website or its contents disappear from the Internet.  All rights to everything about the contents in this directory remain with the original authors (Simon Butler).</p>
