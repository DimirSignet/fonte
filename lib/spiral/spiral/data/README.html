<p>The following are the data files located in this subdirectory.</p>

<code>frequencies.pklz</code> and <code>frequencies.csv</code>
</h2>
<p>A compressed Python pickle file containing a Python <code>dict</code> object.  It constitutes a table of token frequencies that was created from an analysis of over 46,000 randomly selected software projects in GitHub that contained at least one Python source code file.  This file contains only those entries that had frequencies of at least 10; the full (and much larger) table is in <code>frequencies-full.csv</code>.  The <code>frequencies.csv</code> file is a CSV version of the data in the Python dictionary contained in <code>frequencies.pklz</code>.</p>

<p>A compressed Python pickle file containing a Python <code>dict</code> object.  It constitutes a table of token frequencies that was created from an analysis of over 46,000 randomly selected software projects in GitHub that contained at least one Python source code file.  The tokens were extracted using software from Spiral's parent project, <a href="https://github.com/casics">CASICS</a> (specifically, the <a href="https://github.com/casics/extractor">extractor</a> package), and the frequency table constructed using a procedure encoded in the small program <code>create_frequency_file</code> <a href="../../utils/create_frequency_file">included with Spiral</a>.</p>
